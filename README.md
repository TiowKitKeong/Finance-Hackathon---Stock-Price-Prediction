# Finance Hackathon - Stock Price Prediction
## Top 6 Finalists for the Finance Domain Category
For the UM Hackathon 2022 project, our team focused on developing an innovative Stock Price Prediction Model centered around the application of machine learning techniques. The primary objective was to forecast future stock prices by leveraging historical market data and incorporating various relevant factors. The core methodology involved training the model using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method, a powerful technique for handling time series data. To enhance our technical analysis capabilities, we integrated the pandas_ta library, a tool that provides comprehensive functionality for performing technical analysis on financial data. This allowed us to delve into intricate market patterns and trends, empowering the model to make more accurate predictions regarding stock price movements. Our project represents a proactive exploration of the intersection between machine learning and financial markets, aiming to contribute valuable insights and predictions for effective decision-making.
